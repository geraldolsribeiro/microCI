# Welcome to microCI

The complete documentation can be found at [microci.dev](https://microci.dev).

`microCI` is a tool to assist in building continuous integration pipelines.

The main differentiator of `microCI` is the generation of **portable scripts**
and fully **auditable** for executing tasks in **docker containers**.

Since all steps are executed in one or more docker containers, the entire
process becomes reproducible on: a) any developer's machine, b) the server that
will perform automatic builds after commits, c) the server that will perform
deployment to production... In short, the same tool, without dependencies, can
be used on both the developer's machine and the server.

## On the desktop

Using `microCI` on the developer's desktop is very simple:

```bash
microCI | bash
```

In the above command, `microCI` reads a `.microCI.yml` file containing the
description of the pipeline steps and generates a script for executing these
steps. This script is written to standard output and can be chained with other
tools or passed to a `bash` interpreter for execution.

A file called `.microCI.log` is generated with all messages, warnings, errors
from all executed commands and can be analyzed to resolve any problems that may
occur.

## On the server

To run on the server, it is sufficient to expose **webhooks** that, when
triggered, execute `microCI` in the respective project folders.

## Minimum requirements

* A properly configured Docker environment
* Bash shell

## Installation

The installation is equally simple, just copy the executable to a folder that
is in the `PATH`. To completely remove `microCI` from the system, just delete
the file copied to the PATH.

```bash
curl -fsSL https://github.com/geraldolsribeiro/microci/releases/latest/download/microCI \
  -o /usr/local/bin/microCI
chmod 755 /usr/local/bin/microCI
```

## Docker Container

You can use **any Docker container** for execution, both public ones from
[Docker HUB](https://hub.docker.com/) and those you develop internally.

## Integration with github, gitlab, ...

The simplest and safest way to use `microCI` to read from or write to
repositories is to access them through an SSH key.

## To do

Below are some features that may be present in the next releases.

* create deb package
* create rpm package
* pass current user to container to avoid generating files as `root` in the working directory
* display error message from the failed step
* variable substitution in steps
* use of environment variables and secrets configured on the server
* create a Docker image from a git repository
